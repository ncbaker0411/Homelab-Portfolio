# Homelab-Portfolio
This homelab is a self-hosted infrastructure environment designed to build and demonstrate practical skills in systems administration, networking, storage, and virtualization. It functions as both a learning platform and a production-style environment, emphasizing reliability, documentation, and iterative improvement rather than one-off experiments.
