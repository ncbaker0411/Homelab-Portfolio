# Problems
Since I started my IT career path, I’ve encountered several specific issues that I wanted to solve in ways that would clearly demonstrate the skills I’ve learned. Inside this folder, I document the problems I faced and how I applied my knowledge of IT systems to resolve them.

## [Structured Networking](https://github.com/ncbaker0411/Homelab-Portfolio/tree/2cb60c8f064a5dafd3ed08300f3f4ff431b48b1d/Problems/Structured-Networking)
When I started my homelab, it consisted of a stack of unorganized equipment sourced from piles of e-waste. I wanted to ensure that if I present myself as a professional, my homelab and network reflect that level of organization and care.

## [DNS Filtering](https://github.com/ncbaker0411/Homelab-Portfolio/tree/2cb60c8f064a5dafd3ed08300f3f4ff431b48b1d/Problems/DNS-Filtering)
An issue I discovered more recently is how intrusive and overwhelming the number of ads on websites and streaming services can be. To address this, I researched DNS filtering and implemented a solution to block these unwanted ads.

## [NAS Storage](https://github.com/ncbaker0411/Homelab-Portfolio/tree/2cb60c8f064a5dafd3ed08300f3f4ff431b48b1d/Problems/NAS-Storage)
One addition I wanted to make to my home network was Network Attached Storage. Until recently, I didn’t have much of a need for it, but I’ve just become a father. Given how expensive and potentially insecure cloud storage can be, I wanted to develop a solution that removes both of those concerns.

## [Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/ncbaker0411/Homelab-Portfolio/tree/2cb60c8f064a5dafd3ed08300f3f4ff431b48b1d/Problems/Kubernetes-Cluster)
This was less of a personal problem and more of a professional one. While researching IT-related positions, I frequently saw containerization and orchestration listed as required or preferred skills. To address this gap, I increased the availability of services by using multiple Raspberry Pis to build a Kubernetes cluster.

## [Centralized Logging](https://github.com/ncbaker0411/Homelab-Portfolio/tree/2cb60c8f064a5dafd3ed08300f3f4ff431b48b1d/Problems/Centralized-Logging)
This problem is also more professional than personal. I wanted to expose myself to one of the many technologies used in cybersecurity to better prepare myself for that career path.
