# Problems
Since I started my IT career path, I have run into several specific issues that I wanted to solve in a way that would allow me to show off the skills I’ve learned. Inside this folder, I document problems I encountered and how I used my knowledge of IT systems to resolve them.

## Structured Networking
When I started my homelab, it was a stack of unorganized equipment sourced from piles of e-waste. I wanted to ensure that if I present myself as a professional, my homelab and network reflect that as well.

## DNS Filtering
An issue I more recently discovered is how intrusive and overwhelming the number of ads on websites and streaming services can be. To address this, I researched DNS filtering and implemented a solution to block these unwanted ads.

## NAS Storage
Something I wanted to add to my home network was Network Attached Storage. Until recently, I didn’t have much of a reason, but I’ve just become a father. With how expensive and insecure cloud storage can be, I wanted to develop a solution that removes both of those barriers.

## Kubernetes Cluster
This was less of a personal problem and more of a professional one. In my research into IT-related positions, containerization and orchestration were frequently mentioned. I wanted to address this by increasing the availability of services using multiple Raspberry Pis I acquired and building a cluster.

## Centralized Logging
This is another problem that is less personal and more professional. I want to expose myself to one of the many technologies used in cybersecurity to better prepare myself for that career path.
